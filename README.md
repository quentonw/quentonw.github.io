	<h1>Welcome Fellow Traveler</h1>
		<p>What is happening? You're probably here to get some info on traveling through Canada. In my travels I have written stories of my journeys and reviews of cities, and rated the places I have eaten or stayed. One place in particular liked how comprehensive my review was and wanted to share it on their website, soon word spread and establishment owners wanted my reviews for their places as well. Over time I've become the go-to reviewer for vacationers, backpackers, and travelers throughout Canada. </p>
